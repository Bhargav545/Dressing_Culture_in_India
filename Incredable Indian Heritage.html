            <h1><b>INCREDIBLE INDIAN HERITAGE</b></h1>
            <p><i>Incredible India!</i></p>
            <p1>Traditionally, cultural heritage is an expression of the various ways of living developed by a society and passed on through generations, including customs, practices, objects, artistic expressions, and values. Cultural heritage is often expressed as either tangible or intangible.</p1><br><br>
            <p2>As part of human activity, cultural heritage generally produces tangible representations of its value systems, beliefs, traditions, and lifestyles—such as visual art and architecture—as well as the intangible, which includes voices, values, traditions, oral history, spiritual ceremonies, and storytelling.</p2><br>

            <h2 style="color: brown;" id="Religious Culture">Religious Culture</h2>
            <p2>Religion and culture seem like complex ideas to study from the perspective of International Relations. After all, scholars and philosophers have long debated the meaning of these terms and the impact they have had on our comprehension of the social world around us. So is it an impossibly complicated task to study religion and culture at the global level? Fortunately, the answer is <q>no</q>, for we can recognise and respect complexity without being confused about what we mean by each term. In this chapter, which completes the first section of the book, we will explore why thinking about religious and cultural factors in global affairs is as integral as the other issues we have covered thus far.</p2><br><br>
            <p2>What do we mean by the terms <q>religion</q> and <q>culture</q>? Where can we see examples of religion and culture at work in the domains of world politics? How do religious and cultural factors impact on our ability to live together? Our investigation will begin to address these questions. As we do so, we shall keep in mind the encouragement of rabbi and political philosopher Jonathan Sacks, who wrote that <q>sometimes it is helpful to simplify, to draw a diagram rather than a map in order to understand what may be at stake in a social transition</q> (1997, 55). There has indeed been a transition in IR thinking about the value of religion and culture.

            <h2 style="color: brown;" id="Festivals">Festivals</h2>
            <p2>A festival is an extraordinary event celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect or aspects of that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship</p2><br><br>

                <li><b>MAKARA SANKRANTHI</b></li><br>
                <p2>Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the sun and thank for their successes and prosperity.</p2><br>

                <p2>Holi is a Hindu festival that takes place every spring. It's all about new beginnings — Holi welcomes the spring season and celebrates the end of winter. The Holi festival always falls on Purnima, or the day of the full moon. It's a two-day holiday; the day of the March full moon is Holika Dahan.</p2><br>

            <p2>
                A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs, and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.

            <h2 style="color: brown;" id="Clothing">Clothing</h2>
            <p1>Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation</p1><br><br>
            <p1>Clothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on the body. Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations. Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head</p1><br><br>
